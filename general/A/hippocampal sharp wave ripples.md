The most synchronous network pattern in the brain, using 5-15% of the local(hippocampal) neuron population. This mode of activity has manifold purpose. 

It allows the neuronal members to fire independently and randomly, this can allow the hippocampus to wipe the slate, creating a tableau rasa. During sleep or rest this allows the hippocampus to remove synaptic modification created during waking activity and allow for fresh excitation

Alternatively sharp wave ripples can allow for repetition of neuronal pathways used during the day, entrained to the timescale of sharp wave ripples. Allowing for the condensation of experience at times of rest. 

This repetition could be useful in the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity(which lasts for hours, 24 hours). The repeated excitation of the same path may guide proteins created from the gene transcription initiated by communication from the transient synaptic plasticity to the nucleus back to the initial synapse which started the cascade.

Since the sharp wave ripple has such a large ensemble, it can bring together many interactive pathways which interact at the hundred of millisecond timescale into the shorted timescale required for synaptic plasticity. This can create associations between neurons linked more temporally disparate, Unconscious associations.

The short synchronous burst of activity is also especially effective at impacting the neocortex, allowing for information transfer.

Specifically timed sequences of neurons displayed during the learning of a novel activity are expressed during the sleep immediately following as well, but twice as fast--firing during the trough of the sharp wave spike-- compared to the intervals compressed in a single theta cycle. This correlation of spike pathways does not occur in the preceding sleep.
